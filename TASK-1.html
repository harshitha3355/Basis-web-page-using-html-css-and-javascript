            <h3>Black Forest Cake</h3>
            <p>A Black Forest cake is a classic German dessert known for its layers of chocolate sponge, whipped cream, and cherries. To prepare it, begin by baking three layers of moist chocolate sponge cake. Sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat eggs and sugar until fluffy, then fold in the dry ingredients and melted butter. Once the cakes are baked and cooled, slice each in half for thinner layers if desired. For the filling, pit fresh cherries or use canned ones, simmered with sugar and cornstarch until thick. Whip chilled heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. To assemble, brush the layers with cherry syrup or kirsch (cherry liqueur), spread the whipped cream, and add the cherry filling. Stack the layers, covering the top and sides with more whipped cream. Garnish with chocolate shavings, whole cherries, and extra whipped cream for decoration. Refrigerate the cake for a few hours to set the flavors. The combination of the rich chocolate, sweet cherries, and light cream makes for a delightful, indulgent treat that's perfect for special occasions or simply to satisfy a sweet craving.</p>
